  <h1>Investigating Crime <br /> In Boston</h1>
  <h2>Investigators: Gabrielle Bambalan, Rohan Francis, Jackson Goodman, James Hajdenberg</h2>
  <body>
    <p>Project Overview: Our project aims to understand the relationship between the severity of a crime and offense to a location in Boston,
      as we question: How does crime and its severity relate to location in Boston? Through analyzing a large dataset of crimes committed in 
      Boston in the years 2015-2020, one can observe the patterns or trends of a type of crime in certain locations around the city. 
      Attributes included in the dataset include: incident number, offense code, offense code group, offense description, district, reporting area,
      shooting (whether there was a shooting involved), occurred on date, year, month, day of week, hour, UCR part (Uniform Crime Reporting Program), 
      street, latitude, longitude, and location. The dataset had 97871 rows and 15 columns, all relevant to our analysis after cleaning.
      We primarily focus on location, to aid in answering our research question. The larger implications of this project can assist 
      law enforcement in properly allocating resources, as well as developing targeted strategies for crime prevention.

    <p> Figure 1. Using Folium we can visualize the entirety of our dataset. This representation comes in the form of a map of 
      Boston with a variety of points scattered. Each point represents a crime that occurred between 2015 and 2020. 
      When hovering over each point, information is revealed, including, Offense Description and District. Users can filter on 
      specific years using the layer functionality in the top right. In total, a variety of marks and channels are used in this visualization. 
      The marks are points, as well as the provided tooltip information; and the channels are hue, spatial orientation, and position.</p>

    <p>Figure 2. This line chart represents the overall frequency in crimes between the years 2015 and 2020. 
      The year with the most crimes was 2017 with a maximum of 101338, and the year with the least crimes was 
      2015 with a minimum of 53597. The years 2016, 2018, and 2019 all have relatively similar crime frequencies 
      (ranging from 98104 to 99430), while 2020 has a steep drop in crime (going down to 74218). The drop in crime 
      is likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while there is no general explanation as to why crime rate peaked in 2017. 
      The graph was created using Altair. Though it is a fairly simple plot, it still employs the use 
      of multiple marks and channels. The marks are lines, connections, and points, while the channels are positioning 
      and tilt. In conjunction with Figure 1, both visualizations provide a great introduction to the dataset with 
      contextualizing information.</p>

    <p>Figure 3. This bar graph is a representation of the most frequent crime types and offenses from our 
      dataset. The graph includes the ten most frequent crimes, their titles, and their frequency. 
      To make the visualization easier to process, we added horizontal lines at every 100 in the data. Users can hover over
      each bar to reveal the exact number of frequency and crime type. The most frequent crime by 
      far is Assault, specifically Aggravated Battery. This graph was created using Altair and 
      has marks as areas in the form of bars and numerals for text. The channels are size and area. This graph is a great 
      indicator of the most common types of crimes in Boston.

    <iframe src="scatter-hour-day.html" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0"><</iframe>
    <p>Figure 4. This scatter plot illustrates specific time of day and week crimes may occur. The x-axis of this graph 
      is the hour of the day, while the y-axis is the day of the week. Within these points, all 168 hours of a week are 
      represented by a dot. The dot ranges in opacity and size based on the frequency of crime incidents within the 
      specific time frame. This graph can help us understand where the highest frequency of crimes occurs in a 
      typical day and the highest or lowest frequency of crimes occurring in a week. While a city will have a lot 
      of week-to-week, day-to-day, and hour-to-hour fluctuation in crimes and reporting, it provides general insight 
      that shows that there is generally more crime during week days and daytime hours. One interesting trend that 
      can be seen is the larger frequency of crimes from midnight to 2 A.M. during the weekend, both Saturday and Sunday. 
      This plot has marks that are points, but these points took a large variety of channels to represent. These channels 
      include color, shape, and size. Once again, the plot contains tooltip information about the day of the week, 
      the hour of the crime, number of incidents.</p>

    <p>Figure 5. Rather than showing all of the crimes that occurred in Boston, each point represents one 
      street. The street has one point that appears as the average of the latitude and longitude of the crimes on that street.
      While there are thousands of streets in Boston, the top 100 streets with the highest frequency 
      of crimes are displayed on the map. The points on the map differ by size based on the count of their crimes between the years of 2015 
      to 2020. In this case, the largest point is represented by the street with the most crimes, Washington Street. 
      This map was made possible because of the data cleaning and standardizing processes our group underwent. 
      In the end, it was made using Folium. It contained marks that are points and tooltip text information. 
      The channels are size, positioning, and a variety of built-in features included in the Folium map.</p>

    <iframe src="shootings-by-district.html" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0"><</iframe>
    <p>Figure 6. This bar graph created in plotly further reinforces the magnitude of crime by location that was introduced in 
      the map in Figure 5. Of the crimes plotted in that map, how many of them had occurrences of a shooting?
      As the map plotted the number of crimes on each street, this bar graph depicts the violence of such crimes. 
      The darker the red evident in each bar, the greater number of instances of gun violence that occurred during the crime in a specific 
      district in Boston. Hover data reveals the exact number of shootings in a district. The use of color as a channel is 
      effective in calling attention to the district with higher instances of gun use in a committed crime. </p>

    <p>Figure 7. While the map from Figure 5 is helpful, this bar chart created in d3 provides further insight with the top ten streets and 
      their frequency of crimes. This bar chart has marks of bars and highlights a bar upon clicking. The channel used is area. 
      This chart simply contains the frequency of crimes for the top streets with the most crimes in Boston from 2015 to 2020.</p>

    <p>Conclusions:<p>
    <p>With all the above visualizations considered, we have found that high frequencies of crime tend to occur in Roxbury
      and extends to the South End area. The most violent of crimes, however, occur in the neighborhoods of Mattapan and 
      Fenway/Mission Hill. Our work in analyzing Boston crime data can be a foundation for predictive models to forecast
      future crimes, especially location and time wise. In the future, it would be interesting to extend our analyses to
      the recent years after the Covid-19 pandemic, and compare crime statistics.
